        No coffee was brewed, and so I was forced to use a water dispenser instead :/

        If launching ASF with provided configs (below) is everything that is needed, then this section is not mandatory.

    attributes:
      label: Possible reason/solution
      description: Not mandatory, but you can suggest a fix/reason for the bug, if known to you.

      label: Can you help us with this bug report?
      description: ASF is offered for free and our resources are limited. Helping us increases the chance of fixing the problem.
      options:
        - Yes, I can code the solution myself and send a pull request
        - Somehow, I can test and offer feedback, but can't code
        - No, I don't have time, skills or willings for any of that

    id: asf-log
    attributes:
      label: Full log.txt recorded during reproducing the problem
      description: You can find `log.txt` file directly in ASF directory. If the bug report doesn't come from the last run of the program, you can find logs from previous runs of the program in the `logs` directory instead.
      placeholder: |
        If no log.txt was recorded due to crash at the very early stage, console output should be pasted instead.

  - type: textarea
    id: global-config
    attributes:
      label: Global ASF.json config file
      description: The config can be found in `config` directory under `ASF.json` name. You can leave this field empty if not using one.
      placeholder: |
        Paste the file content here, no need for triple backtick tags

        Ensure that your config has redacted (but NOT removed) potentially-sensitive properties, such as:
        - IPCPassword (recommended)
        - SteamOwnerID (optionally)
        - WebProxy (optionally, if exposing private details)
        - WebProxyPassword (optionally, if exposing private details)
        - WebProxyUsername (optionally, if exposing private details)

        Redacting involves replacing sensitive details, for example with stars (***). You should refrain from removing config lines entirely, as their pure existence may be relevant and should be preserved.

    id: bot-config
